This REPO is developed for the 2015 WINLAB SUMMER INTERN PROGRAM.

Project title: Real-Time Cyber Physical Systems Application on MobilityFirst

Introduction:

Most Cyber Physical Systems (​http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-physical_system) are characterized by stringent network requirements both in terms of latency (i.e. less than 100 msec response time) and scalability (i.e. Trillion-order scalability for CPS devices/objects ).

MobilityFirst, thorugh its name based Virtual Network Architecture used to provide Application Specific Routing to services and applications, can be exploited in the attempt of assisting these applications to meet their requirements.

The goal of the project is to implement a CPS Application based on computer vision (i.e. object recognition) that will be used in conjunction with MobilityFirst’s Virtual Network to showcase the benefits of the network service.

Plan:

To simplify whole process, we are now working on both the client side and server side programs based on OPENCV, which provides a great amount of easy to use API to deal with image, video and display stuffs.

For more details, please go see the README in either client folder or server folder.
