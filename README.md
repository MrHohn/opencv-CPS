This REPO is developed for **2015 WINLAB SUMMER INTERN PROGRAM**.

Project title: *Real-Time Cyber Physical Systems Application on MobilityFirst*

## WIKI Introduction:

> Most Cyber Physical Systems (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-physical_system) are characterized by stringent network requirements both in terms of latency (i.e. less than 100 msec response time) and scalability (i.e. Trillion-order scalability for CPS devices/objects ).

## Project Overview

**MobilityFirst**, thorugh its name based **Virtual Network** Architecture used to provide Application Specific Routing to services and applications, can be exploited in the attempt of assisting these applications to meet their requirements.

The goal of the project is to implement a CPS Application based on computer vision (i.e. object recognition) that will be used in conjunction with MobilityFirstâ€™s Virtual Network to showcase the benefits of the network service.

### What has been done:

- Google glass and Linux client programs that is capable to stream video to server.
- Android application as a go between Google glass and the MobilityFirst server.
- CPS server main program using TCP or MobilityFirst network.
- OpenCV object recognition program.
- Cloud computing server based on STORM and Kafka.
- Combination of cloud server Load Metric and Network Virtualization.

For how to configure/compile/install/use the whole system, please go see the README in each folder.
